All messages (including colour and formatting codes) in LuckPerms can be modified and changed. (within reason)

Simply copy [this file](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/blob/master/default-lang.yml) and save it into the LuckPerms folder, and name it as **"lang.yml"**.

Edit the messages in the file to your liking, and then restart your server.


## Translations
I sadly don't speak any other languages, so I cannot provide translations. However, if you know English + some other language, you can do the translations yourself. :grinning:

Of course, I (and everyone else) would be greatful if those who do make translations submit the changes back to the project so others can benefit.

### List of current translations
* None. :cry:
