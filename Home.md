# LuckPerms Wiki

Welcome to the LuckPerms wiki. Here you will find a complete set of documentation for the plugin, outlining how to install, setup, configure and effectively use LuckPerms.

### Where to start?
If you've never used a permissions plugin before, I suggest you read the following tutorials first. They outline how permissions work, and how to use them with your other plugins.

* [Bukkit's Permission Guide](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Understanding_Permissions) (credit: mbaxter & XHawk87)
* [Sponge's Permission Guide](https://docs.spongepowered.org/master/en/server/management/permissions.html) (credit: SpongeDocs contributors)
* [A list of Minecraft permission nodes](http://wiki.bukkit.org/CraftBukkit_Commands) (credit: too many to list)
* [A brief summary of how permissions work](https://www.bisecthosting.com/clients/knowledgebase/87/Introduction-to-permissions.html) (credit: BisectHosting)

If you're happy with all of that, then I suggest you move onto the "**Basic Setup**" page. It's a good idea to familiarise yourself with the documentation before you start creating your permissions setup. ðŸ˜ƒ
