# LuckPerms Wiki

Welcome to the LuckPerms wiki. Here you will find a complete set of documentation for the plugin, outlining how to install, setup, configure and effectively use LuckPerms.

### Where to start?
If you've never used a permissions plugin before, I suggest you start at the top of the **Setup** section and work your way through everything.

The basics are covered in detail in the [Usage](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/wiki/Usage) section. Full command usage is detailed under [Command Usage](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/wiki/Command-Usage).
