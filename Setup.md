Setup is a fairly simple process.

1. Grab the LuckPerms jar that corresponds to your platform.
2. Place the plugin jar in your plugins/mods folder.
3. Start the server once, and let it generate the config file.
4. Stop the server, and fill out the configuration options.

You can change a number of settings in the config file. The file has detailed annotations that should make it clear what each option does.
