LuckPerms has built in support to allow easy migration of permissions data from existing permissions plugins to LuckPerms.

## Before we get started
It should be noted that this system is not perfect. It will do a pretty decent job at converting all of your existing data, and works perfectly in *most cases*. However, not all data is the same, and there are sometimes things I haven't accounted for.

LuckPerms has some similarities with other permission plugins, however, some parts are fundamentally different, and therefore sometimes automatic migration is tricky.

Additionally, letting the plugin migrate all of your data for you means you will not have a chance to learn any of the LuckPerms commands. This may become an issue later on. ðŸ˜‰ If you're migrating from PermissionsEx or GroupManager, you might [find this page useful](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/wiki/GM-&-PEX-Command-Equivalents).

If you have an old permissions setup, or a setup you're not completely happy with, now might be a great time to have a restructure and cleanup, and a chance to learn LuckPerms commands in the process!

Nope?! Happy with what you have? Let's migrate. ðŸ˜ƒ

# How to
The migration process is fairly simple, however it varies slightly for each platform.

1. Place the LuckPerms jar file in your servers plugin folder. ([How to?](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/wiki/Setup))
2. Ensure that the jar of the plugin you are migrating from is **also** in the plugins folder. (don't uninstall it just yet!)
3. Start your server up. You can technically carry out the process on a live production server, however I advise that if possible, you do it on a server with no players.

**Run the following command: `/lp migration <plugin name>`**   

Some plugins also require you to specify extra options/flags. If any are needed, you will be notified in chat before the migration begins.

Then, just let LuckPerms handle the rest! You will be notified of the migration progress, and then notified again once it has finished.

When the process has finished, stop the server, remove the other jar file, and start your server again.

The console output during the migration process is purposely verbose and spammy. Messages starting with "(LP) LOG" can be ignored, however stack traces shouldn't be (they usually mention some sort of exception). If your migration output contains stack traces, please report them to me. More info at the bottom of this page. 

## PowerfulPerms
The process for PowerfulPerms is more complicated.

Users are only loaded into the plugin when they join the server, and the plugins API does not expose a way to get all players from its backend.

This means that during the import process, we have to query the PowerfulPerms MySQL tables to get a list of all users.

The command usage is therefore different.

`/luckperms migration powerfulperms [address] [database] [username] [password] [db table]`

Where:
* address = the address and port of your MySQL server e.g. 127.0.0.1:3306
* database = the name of the database where your PowerfulPerms data is stored
* username = the username to login to the SQL server
* password = the password to login to the SQL server
* db table = the name of the table where player data is stored (although we're only concerned about a list of uuids).

The default db table, as far as I know, is "players", however if you have an added table prefix, you will need to include that too.

e.g. if my table prefix is "pp_", the db table should = "pp_players". (without the quotes)

For example: `/luckperms migration powerfulperms 127.0.0.1:3306 root passw0rd players`

# Errors
If it seems that the command does not exist, check your server's startup log to check if the plugin you are importing from loaded correctly.

If the process doesn't complete and prints an error message, please submit an Issue on GitHub or [contact me here](https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/wiki#cant-find-something). I'll try to reply to you ASAP.
