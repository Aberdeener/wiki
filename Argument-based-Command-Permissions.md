### The base permission
Within this system, the "base" permission refers to the permissions for the command in the documentation.

For example, the base permission for `/lp user Luck permission set` is **luckperms.user.permission.set**.

If a player is to be able to use a command, they **must** have the base permission. By default, this is all that they need to use the command. However, you can enable "extra" permission checks using this system, to further limit what a user can do with each command.

### Enabling extra permission checks
These extra permissions have to be manually enabled for three reasons.

1. To maintain backwards compatibility with older versions of the plugin
2. To make it easier for people to get started with the plugin.
3. "Customizability" is key. :wink:
