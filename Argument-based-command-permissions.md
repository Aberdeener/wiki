When enabled, LuckPerms will run extra permission checks when a player tries to modify or view permission data.

These permissions allow for finer control over what changes a player is able to make, including preventing them from granting specific groups, or making changes in certain contexts.

The extra checks can be broken down into 3 sections.

### Checks when a player modifies/views themselves or other users

### Checks when a player modifies/views another group/track

### Checks when a player makes changes in a specific context

### Checks when a player makes changes with a set of specific arguments
